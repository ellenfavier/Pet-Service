🚀 Pet Service (Microservice)
This is a pet-service, a FastAPI microservice developed for the Software Architecture course. It manages user authentication and assignments.

This service uses MongoDB for data persistence and follows Clean Architecture principles, separating logic into Domain, Usecase, Adapters, and Infrastructure layers.

🛠 Tech Stack
Framework: FastAPI
Database: MongoDB (local) / MongoDB Atlas (cloud)
Containerization: Docker / Docker Compose
Deployment Platform: Render
Validation: Pydantic
Authentication: JWT (python-jose) & Passlib
☁️ 1. Cloud Deployment (Render + MongoDB Atlas)
This is the primary production deployment required by the assignment.

Live Endpoints:

Live URL: https://pet-service-dztd.onrender.com/
Swagger UI (Docs): https://pet-service-dztd.onrender.com/docs
DB Health Check: https://pet-service-dztd.onrender.com/health/db
Deployment Setup
The service is deployed on Render using Docker. It connects to a MongoDB Atlas M0 free-tier cluster.

Environment Variables configured in Render:

MONGO_URI: [Secret] The connection string for the MongoDB Atlas cluster.
DB_NAME: The name of the database (e.g., assignmentdb).
JWT_SECRET: [Secret] A secret key for signing JWT tokens.
PET_SERVICE_URL: (Dummy) http://dummy.com
NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_URL: (Dummy) http://dummy.com
🖥 2. Local Development (Docker Compose)
This mode is used for local development and testing, including interaction with other microservices (pet-service and notification-service).

This configuration runs a fully High-Availability (HA) system of 11 containers:

3 x MongoDB Replica Set nodes
1 x mongo-setup
2 x task-service
2 x pet-service
2 x notification-service
1 x nginx-lb (Load Balancer)
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites:

Docker
Docker Compose
How to Run:

Ensure all 3 service folders (task-service, pet-service, notification-service) and the 2 config files (docker-compose.yml, nginx.conf) are in the same root directory.

Run the following command in your terminal:

docker-compose up --build
Local Endpoints:

Task Service: http://localhost:8081
Pet Service: http://localhost:8082
Notification Service: http://localhost:8083
